# Vigenère Cipher App 🔐

Welcome to the **Vigenère Cipher App**! This project is a tool to encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Vigenère cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

## Features ✨

- **Encryption**: Securely encode your messages with a keyword of your choice.
- **Decryption**: Easily decode messages with the correct keyword.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for seamless use.
- **Cross-platform**: Built with Flutter, so it's available on both Android and iOS.

# How the Vigenère Cipher Works 🔍
The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques.

# Example 💫:
Message: HELLO
Keyword: KEY
Encrypted: RIJVS
